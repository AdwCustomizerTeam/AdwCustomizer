# Monet Engine 

Monet generates a material color 3 palette from a background.

Gradience is using a fork of the python implementation.

You can find it at [material-color-utilities-python](https://GitHub.com/GradienceTeam/material-color-utilities-python)

Currently, we are using a python .whl but it would be great to use as a meson subproject.
